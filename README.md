# Plot.ly excersie
Plot.ly exercise  was based a data pulled from Belly Button Biodiversity. In this exercise we used Json file stored in a Desktop to populate the reports and do Analysis on. 

In this exercise we used  the ID field to filter the data through Horizontal bar, bubble plot, and gauges. 

In the horizontal bar we filtered the top 10 sample size by using the data in the sample_values. 
In the bubble we charted the Sample Values to show the sample size sample_values and ID
In the gauges we created a report that will take the frequency of belly button wash of the individual to show the number of washes for each of the ID.
